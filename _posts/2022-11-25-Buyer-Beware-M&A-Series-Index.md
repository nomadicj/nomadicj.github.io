## Introduction

As an engineering leader, you will occasionally be asked to evaluate a merger or acquisition opportunity. Industries and businesses have cycles of consolidation, and when your company considers acquiring another organization, you'll be required to assess the engineering and product operations capability of the target company.

Most technical leaders instinctively focus on what we know bestâ€”the code and architecture. But successful M&A due diligence requires a much broader perspective. This series provides a comprehensive framework for evaluating acquisition targets beyond just the technical implementation.

## Why This Matters

Failed acquisitions often stem from overlooked operational, cultural, or structural issues that become expensive problems post-integration. As the technical voice in M&A decisions, your assessment can mean the difference between a successful acquisition that drives growth and a costly mistake that drains resources.

## The Complete Series

This guide is organized into focused articles covering each critical evaluation area:

## How to Use This Guide

Each article in this series can stand alone for targeted evaluation, but they're designed to work together as a comprehensive assessment framework. Consider:

1. **Pre-evaluation planning**: Review all articles to understand the full scope before beginning your assessment
2. **Targeted deep-dives**: Focus on specific articles based on your acquisition goals (acquihire vs. product vs. customer base)
3. **Team collaboration**: Share relevant sections with legal, finance, and product teams for coordinated due diligence
4. **Integration planning**: Use findings to inform post-acquisition integration strategies
