## Operations Assessment Framework

When evaluating an acquisition target, operational maturity often reveals more about long-term viability than the product itself. A brilliant product built on unstable operational foundations becomes a liability, while a solid operational foundation can support rapid improvement and scaling.

This guide provides a systematic approach to evaluating the operational capabilities that will determine post-acquisition success.

## Dependencies and Licensing

### Intellectual Property Audit
Are there parts of the codebase the target company doesn't own? Startups often adopt a "move fast, deal with legal later" approach that can create significant post-acquisition complications.

**Key Questions:**
- What open source packages are in use and under what licenses?
- Are there any GPL or other copyleft licenses that could require disclosure?
- Has the company performed regular license audits?
- Are there any pending IP disputes or claims?

**Red Flags:** GPL components in proprietary products, missing license documentation, or a history of "we'll deal with that later" responses to IP questions.

### Third-Party Component Strategy
Understanding the balance between build vs. buy decisions reveals both technical maturity and future cost structure.

**Evaluation Criteria:**
- Ratio of proprietary code to third-party dependencies
- Quality and sustainability of chosen dependencies
- Vendor lock-in risks and migration complexity
- License cost scaling with user growth

**Consider:** A heavy reliance on third-party components isn't necessarily problematic, but understanding the strategic rationale and long-term cost implications is crucial.

## Operating Expense Analysis

### Cloud Infrastructure Costs
Cloud spend as a percentage of revenue provides insight into both technical efficiency and business model sustainability.

**Assessment Framework:**
- **Cost per customer/user**: Does the unit economics make sense?
- **Cost growth trajectory**: Is spending scaling linearly or exponentially with growth?
- **Optimization efforts**: Is there a roadmap to address inefficiencies?
- **Reserved capacity strategy**: Are they managing costs strategically?

**Benchmark Questions:**
- "What's your cloud spend as a percentage of recurring revenue?"
- "What are your three largest cost drivers?"
- "What optimization work is in your current backlog?"

### Customer Support Overhead
High support costs often indicate product usability issues or incomplete feature development.

**Key Metrics:**
- Support cost per customer
- Ticket volume trends
- Resolution time patterns
- Escalation frequency

**Red Flags:** Support costs growing faster than customer base, repetitive tickets indicating systemic issues, or lack of self-service capabilities.

### Professional Services Dependency
Understanding whether you're acquiring a product company or a services company disguised as a product company.

**Critical Assessment:**
- Revenue split between product licenses and professional services
- Customer success rates with minimal professional services
- Standardization of implementation processes
- Self-service adoption rates

**Warning Signs:** New customers requiring extensive professional services, custom implementations for most deals, or services revenue growing faster than product revenue.

## Operational Maturity

### Development Operations (DevOps)
Modern software delivery practices indicate both team capability and product reliability.

#### Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD)
**Maturity Indicators:**
- Automated testing coverage and quality
- Deployment frequency and success rates
- Rollback capabilities and procedures
- Environment parity (dev/staging/production)

**Questions to Ask:**
- "How do you deploy to production?"
- "What's your deployment frequency?"
- "How do you handle rollbacks?"
- "What's your automated test coverage?"

#### Version Control and Code Management
**Assessment Areas:**
- Branch management strategy
- Code review processes
- Release management procedures
- Documentation quality and coverage

### Infrastructure and Architecture

#### Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
**Evaluation Points:**
- Percentage of infrastructure managed as code
- Version control for infrastructure changes
- Environment reproducibility
- Disaster recovery capabilities

**Red Flags:** Manual infrastructure management, inconsistent environments, or lack of documented procedures.

#### Scalability and Performance
**Technical Assessment:**
- Load testing practices and results
- Monitoring and alerting systems
- Performance optimization history
- Capacity planning processes

#### Security Posture
**Security Fundamentals:**
- Access control and authentication systems
- Data encryption (at rest and in transit)
- Security incident response procedures
- Compliance framework adherence

**Critical Questions:**
- "Who has production access and why?"
- "How do you handle security incidents?"
- "What compliance requirements do you meet?"
- "When was your last security audit?"

## Data Literacy and Monitoring

A team's relationship with data reveals their product understanding and operational sophistication.

### Operational Metrics
**Infrastructure Monitoring:**
- System performance metrics (CPU, memory, disk, network)
- Application performance monitoring (APM)
- Error rates and patterns
- Cost allocation and tracking

**Business Metrics:**
- Customer usage patterns
- Feature adoption rates
- Performance impact on user experience
- Revenue attribution to technical improvements

### DORA Metrics
The DevOps Research and Assessment (DORA) metrics provide industry-standard benchmarks for engineering effectiveness:

**Core Metrics:**
- **Deployment Frequency**: How often code is deployed to production
- **Lead Time for Changes**: Time from code commit to production deployment
- **Change Failure Rate**: Percentage of deployments causing production issues
- **Time to Recovery**: How quickly the team recovers from production incidents

**Assessment Approach:**
If these metrics aren't already tracked, conduct informal assessment through interviews and observation. The absence of these metrics itself indicates maturity level.

### Product Analytics
**User Behavior Understanding:**
- Monthly/Daily Active Users (MAU/DAU)
- Feature utilization patterns
- User journey analytics
- Conversion funnel analysis

**Product Development Insights:**
- A/B testing capabilities
- Feature flag management
- User feedback integration
- Data-driven decision making processes

## Risk Assessment and Mitigation

### Technical Debt Evaluation
**Debt Categories:**
- Code quality and maintainability
- Infrastructure modernization needs
- Security vulnerability backlogs
- Documentation and knowledge gaps

### Business Continuity Planning
**Disaster Recovery:**
- Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and Recovery Point Objective (RPO)
- Backup and restore procedures
- Geographic redundancy
- Incident response playbooks

**Operational Resilience:**
- Single points of failure identification
- Key person dependencies
- Vendor relationship management
- Compliance and audit readiness

## Integration Planning Considerations

### Operational Compatibility
**Assessment Areas:**
- Technology stack alignment
- Deployment pipeline compatibility
- Monitoring and alerting integration
- Security policy alignment

### Migration and Consolidation
**Planning Factors:**
- Timeline for operational integration
- Cost of maintaining parallel systems
- Risk mitigation during transition
- Success metrics for integration

## Conclusion

Operational assessment requires looking beyond current functionality to understand the foundation upon which future growth will be built. A target company with solid operational practices can scale efficiently and integrate smoothly, while operational deficiencies often become expensive post-acquisition problems.

Key takeaways for your operational assessment:

1. **Cost structure sustainability**: Ensure unit economics support profitable growth
2. **Operational maturity**: Look for automated, repeatable processes
3. **Data-driven culture**: Teams that measure and optimize tend to improve continuously
4. **Risk management**: Understand and plan for operational risks before they become problems
5. **Integration complexity**: Factor operational differences into your acquisition timeline and budget
