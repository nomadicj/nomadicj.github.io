Had a few conversations over the last few days regarding how to weigh work priority. My internal rubric for priority is something like this:
- Production impacting issues
  - Production down
  - Client experience severely limited
- Colleague(s) blocked
  - team blocked
  - individual blocked
- Product work - Tech-debt work - Self optimisation (60:30:10 or thereabouts)

Does this align with what others are already thinking? Do you have alternative ways of looking at the world?
