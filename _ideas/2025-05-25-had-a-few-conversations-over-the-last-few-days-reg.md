Had a few conversations over the last few days regarding how to weigh work priority. My internal rubric for priority is something like this: - Production impacting issues -- Production down -- Client experience severely limited - Colleague(s) blocked -- team blocked -- individual blocked - Product work - Tech-debt work - Self optimisation (60:30:10 or thereabouts) Does this align with what others are already thinking? Do you have alternative ways of looking at the world?
