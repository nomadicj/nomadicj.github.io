Bees are amazing. Organic. Like dev teams. 

We can learn from nature. Split the hive. Create a replica that understands the same rules, the same landscapes, the same ways of working.

How does it work with bees? Naturally a hive gets so successful and creates so many workers that eventually some cannot sense the queens pheromones. Fearing she is lost they bring on another queen and then there are two. The original, sensing that her time with that hive is coming to an end in the presence of the new queen, flees the hive. Those that sense her as the leader follow, those that sense the new queen, stay. Voila. We have two hives from the same core of bees. Sharing the same rules, knowing the same landscapes and having the same ways of working.

That's all lovely, but what does that mean for Dev teams? Something pretty similar. As part of the development of any healthy and high functioning team we have, over the months and years, been developing our people.

By setting expectations as to what growth looks like for all a senior engineer, who has shown themselves capable of holding their own as the tech lead of another team, has emerged. When the opportunity to create a new team arises we push them to leave the hive, ahem, team. But not as a single person who then has to struggle to build a whole new team. We augment them with a small group of other with whom they already know how they work, who know how the wider working group works and who know how the company works.

New members can be augmented to both teams to bolster their numbers who will, in time, learn the ways of the organisation. After a little while we have two healthy and fully functional teams from the original one.
