## How do adhoc engineering projects work?

### People
Nominated lead engineer early collaborator/adopter group

### Stages
#### POC phase
Expectation; kick the tires. Pretty subjective and relies upon engineers to make a reasonable assessment of the relevance and usefulness of a thing.  Get a sense of the maturity and scope of the project. Given a set of basic requirements based on a realistic use case.

Deliverables:
- Initial statement of scope.
- Experience of attempting to implement basic functionality
- Assessment of whether it would be able to handle the use cases as they are understood (relies on the engineer(s) in question having a good grounding and contextual awareness)
- Tech leadership go/no go meeting (or part of a wider meeting)

#### Industrialisation phase; Early Adopter
Expectation; Create an MVP starting delivery that gets a use case to production.

Deliverables:
- Initial implementation of basic functionalities
- Architectural consideration for wider implementation
- Implementation of tool/paradigm/thing for the early adopter use case
- Assessment of whether to proceed with wider adoption given experience
- Collateral to support wider adoption by all teams

Comms:
- Initiation statement announcing goal, MVP scope and participants
- Periodic (frequent) statements of progress to keep those depending/waiting for delivery aware and engaged
- Initial Mission Accomplished statement. "We aimed to do an MVP thing. We did the MVP thing. Here's what we found and how it works"

#### Industrialisation phase; Mass Adoption
Expectation; Education and support of teams as they implement

Deliverables:
- Education sessions
- Evolution of collateral
- Rollout plan to be agreed and handed off to PM type to oversee
- Disengagement/handoff to BAU once deemed "complete" or "good enough"
