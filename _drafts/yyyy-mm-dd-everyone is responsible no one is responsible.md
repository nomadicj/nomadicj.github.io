Responsibility is a tough concept. What does it mean to be responsible for something? In an age where offending people can lead to some pretty dire consequences, people shy away from responsibility. 

Responsibility means accountability. Accountability means you have to make something happen and to do that you have to make decisions that not everyone will agree with. 

Stong opinions, weakly held. 

We need to be able to have differing opinions, discuss those differences and respect that someone has ultimate responsibility for delivering. It is incumbent on that person to be respectful, to work to make sure they are examining a decision point from all angles. As much as it is the responsibility of the individuals consulted to share their strongly held, informed, rational and considered opinions and then accept the outcome of the discussion, moving on and accepting that the person responsible for the decision is also doing their best.
